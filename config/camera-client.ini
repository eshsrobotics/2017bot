# This is the comma-separated list of IP addresses and DNS names that we try

# camera-client is a client without a server and it gives up.
#
# * 1759 is our team number.
#
# * 10.17.59.2 is the default IP address when the RoboRIO is connected to the DriverStation via USB cable.
#
# * 10.17.59.25 *seems* to be the fixed address that is used when the RoboRIO
#   is not connected to the USB cable and relies exclusively on Wi-Fi.  Which
#   makes us wonder why it's not used in the "Trying Static Ethernet" section
#   of ~/wpilib/java/current/ant/build.xml.  Truly one of life's great
#   mysteries.

# In order to tell the users our status (incluuding whether we were actually
# able to talk to those roborio_addresses), we need to be able to reach a
# machine in the network that they are sitting at.  That machine is the Driver
# Station, a laptop which can run our optional logging application to pick up
# our messages.
#
# Naturally, we don't know what IP address the driver station will have in the
# robot's network.  That's why there's a config setting for it.
#
# It's not a big deal if we can't reach the reporting address

# This controls where we read the images that the camera takes.  If this setting is blank, the
# PapasVision code is just going to assume that it doesn't have a live camera and we'll
# read from the samples folder in Git.
#
# WARNING: if this is not set by the time the robot is on the field, you will NOT be getting
# live camera images to process.  You'll be processing sample images and aiming at random targets.
