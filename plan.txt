STATUS
    2017-01-10:

      - CANTalon motor controllers work just fine when driven by the new (as
        of this year) third-party TalonSRXLibJava.  We shouldn't have a
        problem continuing to use the Talons this year, or with using them to
        drive Mechanum wheels.  The drive train this year is easy and only
        needs one joystick unless we get fancy.

      - To alleviate my own cranial pressure when debugging the drive, Talon
        assignments for the wheels were changed to 0, 1, 2, and 3 for the
        front left, back left, front right, and back right respectively.
        Imagine a backward "N" drawn on top of the robot and you'll have the
        right idea.

    2017-01-11:

      - Compilation error fixed with commit 4cd44d6.  The key was putting the
        correct relative path in the userLibs variable from build.properties.
        That appears to be the only way to edit the classpath used by the
        javac compiler (the Eclipse IDE uses a different classpath that is
        driven by the GUI.)

    2017-02-01:

      - Uche has received a request to convert a formula.  It has something to
        do with blasting people that have green shirts on.

        v = some velocity (an input variable.)
        t = (-0.866 * v + sqrt((sin(60) * v)^2 - 4*26.362))/-19.6
        X_f = cos(60) * v * t + (cos(60) * v * (sin(60) * v - 9.8*t))/9.8

        Express v in terms of t and X_f.  Use the power of Emacs.
        Or Wolfram Alpha, if you can get the beast working.

        * Update: v in terms of t according to Emacs:

          v = (sqrt(1152.48 t^2 + 0.0185588475782) - 33.9472 t) / 8.7999998e-5

          v in terms of X_f and t:

          [v = (3e-13 t - sqrt(9e-26 t^2 + 0.176739878323 X_f)) / 0.0883699391617]

TASKS
  1. Finish crimping the frayed CANTalon wiring so that we can get proper
     electrical contacts.

  2. Fork a Java thread in robotInit() to listen on a port for network
     requests.  Log whatever's received.

  3. Test client using netcat to send requests to the IP of the RoboRIO over
     the known port.

  4. Start work on a formal client using C++ code to do the same as (3).

     * Client tasks:

       (1) sudo make install should place the program in such a place that the
       program will be executed when the NVidia Jetson TK1 reboots.  Probably
       the easiest way to do this is with the root crontab's "@reboot
       /path/to/script" feature.

       As for the path to the script, it will be a path in a directory
       controlled by an unprivileged user.  That way, we'll be able to update
       the program and the config file from the driver station and the crontab
       will automatically pick up the changes on reboot.

       (2) We need to take at least one command-line argument: the path to our
       config file.  Otherwise, our code would have to guess based on
       hard-coded absolute or relative paths, and since we're going to be a
       cron job run by root with a current directory of who-knows-where, that
       doesn't seem like a good idea.

CONFIGURATION
1. Useful Git config settings:

   git config user.name YourUserName
   git config user.email YourEmail@Address.com

   [This command allows you to do free-form commits with Notepad++ if it's
   installed in the right folder.  Feel free to modify the path.]

   git config --global core.editor "'C:/Users/frc1/Documents/Notepad++Portable/Notepad++Portable.exe' -multiInst -notabbar -nosession -noPlugin"

   [This command defines a command, "git ll", which is more useful than the
   normal "git log" command, and then a short version, "git l".]

   git config alias.ll '!git log --graph --decorate --color --stat | git name-rev --stdin --refs=refs/heads/master | less -r'
