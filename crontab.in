# A simple crontab file that allows the C++ camera-client to be run at boot
# time from the NVidia Jetson system-on-a-chip.  camera-client, when run with
# no arguments, will continue to find vision solutions from the live camera
# feed over and over and send those to the roboRIO hostnames specified in
# conf/camera-client.ini.
#
# Install this as the user-level crontab with "crontab
# @CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR@/crontab".  This only needs to be done once as
# long as the crontab doesn't change.
#
# The @reboot keyword is a cron feature (read 'man 5 crontab').

@reboot    cd @CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR@ && bin/camera-client
